# Pandas-Challenge
This Assignment 3 was created in conda version 4.13.0 in "PythonData" environment using Pandas and Jupyter Noteboook.

The folder Instructions contains a Resources folder, a PyCitySchools_starter Jupyter source file that was provided as a guide, and the PyCitySch Jupyter source file, which is the assignment. Inside the Resourcse folder are two csv files, "schools_complete" and "students_complete" that contains the data for the schools in the local government area.

Key metrics that were determined are:

1. Local Government Area (LGA) Summary
    The following data for the LGA were summarised:
    - Total schools
    - Total students
    - Total budget
    - Average maths score
    - Average reading score
    - % passing maths (the percentage of students who passed maths)
    - % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
    - % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed maths AND reading)

2. School Summary
    The following data about each school were summarised:
    - School name
    - School type
    - Total students
    - Total school budget
    - Per student budget
    - Average maths score
    - Average reading score
    - % passing maths (the percentage of students who passed maths)
    - % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
    - % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed maths AND reading)

3. Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)

4. Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)

5. Maths Scores by Year

6. Reading Scores by Year

7, Scores by School Spending

8. Scores by School Size

9. Scores by School Type


For each matrix, a summary table was created.
